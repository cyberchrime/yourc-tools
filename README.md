# yoUR-C Tools

yoUR-C Tools is the approach of configuring the Steinberg UR-C audio
interfaces' DSP from linux. All knowledge about the interface and the
communication was gained by reverse engineering the USB communication
of the [dspMixFx application by Steinberg](https://o.steinberg.net/de/support/downloads_hardware/downloads_ur_c.html). 


## Support this Project

Development is still in a very early stage. Help is welcomed with open
arms.

### Consider a donation

Much effort was invested to create this project.


### Help reverse engineering

Many details about the Steinberg UR44C and its protocols are not yet
well understood or even unknown. If you do have experience in
reverse engineering applications, protocols and more, please
support this project.


### Coding

All gained experience should be accessible for regular end-user in an
easy to use GUI application. If you have improvements to share, please
create a pull request.


### Test it on your device

If you 
These tools might work on several audio interfaces, including the
UR44C, UR22C, UR24C and more. Please give it a try and create issues
in case you encounter any issues.

In case you do have coding experience, you may share fixes and improvements
by creating a pull request.
